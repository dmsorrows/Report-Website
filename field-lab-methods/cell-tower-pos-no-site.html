    the archeologist excavated one shovel test locale as proximal as possible to
    the Project Area. The shovel test locale was investigated roughly 4 meters to
    the west-northwest of the Project Area (Figure 35). All the soils from
    excavated shovel test locale were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. The
    shovel test locale was approximately 40 centimeter (cm) in diameter. The
    subsurface investigation extended at least 20 cm into the subsoil.
    Additionally, the shovel test locale was excavated in 10 cm levels. The soil

    the soils from excavated shovel test locales were screened through ¼-inch
    hardware cloth. Shovel tests were a minimum of 40 centimeter (cm) in diameter.
    Subsurface investigations typically extended 20 cm into the subsoil, until such
    point as a determination could be made regarding the nature of the soils, or an
    obstruction prohibited further excavation. Additionally, shovel test locales
    were excavated in 10 cm levels. The soil stratigraphy was recorded for each
    shovel test using Munsell color charts and standard soil textural descriptions.
    Representative samples of the shovel test profiles are shown in Figures 29 and
    31. Table 2 contains a shovel test inventory for the project. The ground
    surface of the proposed Project Area was examined during the pedestrian survey.
    The AT&amp;T Mobility Lease Parcel, Guy Wire Anchor Locations, and Proposed
    Access and Utility Easement were walked in roughly 5-m intervals, trending
    north/south beginning at the northwest corner of the proposed Project Area.
    Ground surface visibility was poor, varying between 0 percent and 25 percent.
    Tall vegetation and leaf litter hindered surface visibility. Representative
    views of the landscape within the proposed Project Area are shown in Figures 32
