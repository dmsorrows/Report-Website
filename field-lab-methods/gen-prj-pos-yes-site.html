    sites that contain artifacts with varying date ranges (e.g., an assemblage

    Specific Post-Contact artifact types can be used to date sites in reports such
    as stoneware, nails, bottles, jar glass, etc. For example, stoneware roughly
    dates from the middle nineteenth century through the 1930s. Stoneware vessel
    types were increasingly replaced by glass canning jars beginning after the
    first decade of the twentieth century. However, stoneware vessels were produced
    over a long period, were often long-lived, and passed through generations. It
    is important to consider this when considering the manufacture date
    (Stewart-Abernathy 1980, Stelle 2001). Likewise, the broad temporal expanse of
    earthenware production confounds efforts to establish firm dates. Stoneware and
    earthenware are common in the region of the Project Area and well-documented
    throughout nineteenth and twentieth century sites in Arkansas. </span><span
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Whiteware,
    non-vitreous white bodied earthenware, are generally almost pure white in
    color. Majewski and O’Brien (1987:119) argue that earthenware producers were
    probably by the popularity of bone china in the first quarter of the nineteenth
    century. By 1840 whiteware was established as a separate earthenware type and
    it is still produced today. Whiteware is decorated and an assortment of
    decorative techniques was used at various times throughout the nineteenth and
    twentieth centuries.</span></p>

    Post-Contact artifact types can be used to date sites in reports such as
    stoneware, nails, bottles, jar glass, etc. For example, stoneware roughly dates
    from the middle nineteenth century through the 1930s. Stoneware vessel types
    were increasingly replaced by glass canning jars beginning after the first
    decade of the twentieth century. However, stoneware vessels were produced over
    a long period, were often long-lived, and passed through generations. It is
    important to consider this when considering the manufacture date
    (Stewart-Abernathy 1980, Stelle 2001). Likewise, the broad temporal expanse of
    earthenware production confounds efforts to establish firm dates. Stoneware and
    earthenware are common in the region of the Project Area and well-documented throughout
    nineteenth and twentieth century sites in Arkansas. </span><span

    century. By 1840 whiteware was established as a separate earthenware type and
    it is still produced today. Whiteware is decorated and an assortment of

    Branam, RPA, served as the principal investigator for the project. The

    was conducted on June 18th, 2021. GBMc &amp; Associates provided Flat Earth
    Archeology with a map and KMZs detailing the perimeter of the Project Area
    prior to the commencement of fieldwork (Figure 23). Flat Earth Archeology
    utilized ArcMap 10.4 to establish one transect within the Project Area and
    created a polyline shapefile delineating the transect. Additionally, personnel
    established shovel test locales along the transect polyline shapefile at 20-m
    intervals. Shapefiles were created based upon the shovel test locale point
    data. Flat Earth Archeology converted these shapefiles to KMZs. The
    archeologist utilized these devices to maintain real-time location data on
    handheld electronic mapping devices, allowing the archeologist to accurately
    investigate each shovel test locale along the prescribed transect within the
    Project Area. Field data was recorded using custom fillable PDF forms on
    portable devices. The forms provided fields for transect, shovel test number,

    sites that contain artifacts with varying date ranges (e.g., an assemblage

    Post-Contact artifact types can be used to date sites in reports such as
    stoneware, nails, bottles, jar glass, etc. For example, stoneware roughly dates
    from the middle nineteenth century through the 1930s. Stoneware vessel types
    were increasingly replaced by glass canning jars beginning after the first
    decade of the twentieth century. However, stoneware vessels were produced over
    a long period, were often long-lived, and passed through generations. It is
    important to consider this when considering the manufacture date
    (Stewart-Abernathy 1980, Stelle 2001). Likewise, the broad temporal expanse of
    earthenware production confounds efforts to establish firm dates. Stoneware and
    earthenware are common in the region of the Project Area and well-documented throughout
    nineteenth and twentieth century sites in Arkansas. </span><span

    non-vitreous white bodied earthenware, are generally almost pure white in

    probably by the popularity of bone china in the first quarter of the nineteenth
    century. By 1840 whiteware was established as a separate earthenware type and
    it is still produced today. Whiteware is decorated and an assortment of

    surface visibility was poor, varying between 0 percent and 25 percent. Short
    grass hindered surface visibility. Representative views of the landscape of the
    Project Area are shown in Figures 18 through 28. All the soils from excavated
    shovel tests were screened through ¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests were a
    minimum of 30 centimeter (cm) in diameter. Subsurface
    investigations typically extended 50 cm below the ground surface, 20 cm into
    the subsoil, until such point as a determination could be made regarding the
    nature of the soils, or an obstruction prohibited further excavation.
    Additionally, the archeologists excavated in 10 cm levels at each shovel test.</span></p>
