    (2002: 91) casts the Woodland period Fourche Maline culture, which arose
    between 1,000 and 500 BCE, as the predecessor to the circa 800 CE Caddo in the
    Trans-Mississippi South. One unsolved problem confounding this chronology is
    the inconsistency between Fourche Maline and Caddo burial traditions. The
    exceptional complexes of the Early Mississippi Caddo, typified by deep tombs
    and evidence of social stratification with pottery, textiles, celts, bows, and
    prestige goods, do not appear to be a continuation of a tradition from the
    preceding and relatively inconspicuous Fourche Maline. Schambach came to the
    conclusion that the evidence does not support a contention that one evolved
    into the other. Sometime toward the end of the first millennium CE., the Fourche
    Maline practices in the region ceased and the early Caddo practice, typified by
    Mound C at Crenshaw arose (Schambach 2002: 111-112).</span></p>

    cultural landscape that included interactions with cultures to the east and
    west. Nevertheless, the Caddo lived on the margin of the Eastern Woodlands, and

    Nation 2016). Seventeenth and eighteenth-century descriptions of the Caddo
    recount people living near the Red River Valley in the four-state area. There
    were three confederations of the Caddo: the Hasinai of east Texas, the
    Kadohadacho from the Great Bend area of the Red River, and the Natchitoches in

    the early Post-Contact period, the Caddo people’s primary European interaction
    was with French colonials. The French maintained diplomatic, commercial, and
    personal relations with the Caddo. In 1783, Spain took control of the Louisiana
    colony and maintained a relatively good relationship with the Caddo, using the
    French system as a model (Lee 2014). The Caddo maintained a substantial level
    of influence among the French and Spanish colonials, building alliances that
    strengthened them against invading Osage and facilitated trade. The Hasinai
    lived in the southern Spanish territory that would become Mexico. The
    Kadohadacho to the north became the focus of the United States as a regional
    ally (Meredith 2009).</span></p>

    a brief return to French control in 1800, the territory came under the aegis of
    the United States after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Within five years,
    thousands of American settlers had moved in the territory; they cleared land,
    built sugar and cotton plantations, and maintained a thriving slave trade. In
    time, the American settlers recognized the agricultural promise of the Caddo
    homeland in the Red River valley. This led to increasing pressure,
    marginalization of the Caddo, and ultimately, removal (Lee 2014).</span></p>

    signed the Treaty of Greeneville giving up all of their land except the
    northwestern corner of present-day Ohio. Not all Indians agreed with their
    Tribe’s actions, including Tecumseh. Tecumseh decided that the best way to stop
    white settlers from advancing onto their lands was to form a confederacy of
    Indian tribes west of the Appalachian Mountains. He believed that no single
    tribe owned the right to turn land over to the whites; and if the Indians
    united together they would have a better chance against the Americans and
    keeping what was rightfully theirs. Tecumseh visited many tribes west of the
    mountains between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, trying to convince them to
    unite together. With the help of his brother, Tenskwatawa (The Prophet), and
    his proclamation of his visions from the Master of Life, the Shawnee Indians’
    primary god, many natives agreed to join the two brothers at Prophetstown, a
    village the two had established in 1808. William Henry Harrison, governor of
    the Indiana Territory, learned of the growing numbers of Indians in
    Prophetstown. In 1811 Harrison led his army toward the village, and while he

    Valley (Dorsey 1886; Hunter et al. 2013). During the Middle Woodland period,
    circa A.D. 200 to A.D. 600, the group travelled west toward the confluence of

    A.D. 900, the Quapaw continued down the Mississippi to the confluence with the
    Arkansas River while the Kaw, Osage, Ponca, and Omaha moved through the
    Mississippi River Valley to the St. Louis area as well as various river
    drainages in parts of present-day Missouri and Illinois. The Ponca and Omaha
    moved northwest to present-day eastern Nebraska during the beginning of the Mississippian

    as well, circa A.D. 1200-1250 (Hunter et al. 2013). By the end of the

    St. Louis area and traveled westward to central and western Missouri to
    eventually settle along the Osage and Missouri Rivers (Hunter et al. 2013).

    Earth people to the south. Subsistence strategies included hunting, gathering,
    and gardening (Sabo et al. 1990, Sabo 1992). Villages had two leaders, and a
    council of advisors selected from the two clans. Daily life followed the rules
    and customs established by a group of elders. These elders underwent training
    that lasted from boyhood though seven stages of learning. The Osage traded with
    American settlers. Through these trade relationships, the Osage were able to
    acquire guns and horses that dramatically expanded their territory and control

    Quapaw social organization centered on a patrilineal system that united

    The clans were linked through descent from a common ancestor, a factor that
    supported mutual obligation for the members (Wilson and Sabo 1990:1). The tribe

    a platform. Quapaw houses were constructed of arched poles covered in bark.

    involved in trade with early British colonists, but they did trade with the
    French (Sabo 1992). By 1706, the Tunica had abandoned their villages and moved
    to the mouth of the Red River. Trade intensified as the Tunica became military
    allies of the French. This relationship made the Tunica the targets of
    retribution by other local tribes. Continued pressure from white settlers,
    diseases, and hostile Indians groups forced the Tunica to migrate several times
    before they eventually settled among the Biloxi Indians along the Red River
    near present-day Marksville, Louisiana (Sabo 1992).</span></p>

    12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Archaeologists believe that the
    heritage of the Wichita may be traced back to the Plains Village period of
    prehistory which began about 1200 years ago. The Plains Village cultures of the
    central and southern Plains, possibly related to the Wichita, inhabited a vast
    territory encompassing most of the present day states of Kansas, Oklahoma, and
    most of the northern half of Texas, including the panhandle. In central and
    western Oklahoma, one of these ancestral Wichita cultures, is known as the
    Washita River phase. Living along fertile valleys, these people resided in
    small villages of rectangular, mud-plastered houses. Nearby were small gardens
    where women tilled and weed corn, beans, and squash with hoes of buffalo leg
    and shoulder bones. Buffalo, elk, deer, and small game were hunted. Wild plants
    were collected for foods, medicines, and rituals. Tools were made from readily
    available stone, wood bone, and antler. Between A.D. 1350 and 1450, some
    Washita River people began to build larger villages with circular grass houses,
    some of which were fortified. Others apparently moved northward to the Great
    Bend of the Arkansas, a land known to later Spanish explorers as Quivira.</span></p>

    Vasquez de Coronado in 1541, the Quiviran ancestors of the Wichita were
    following a way of life that continued into the nineteenth century. Near their
    large grass house villages, women tilled their gardens while the men hunted
    buffalo and other game. Trade was extensive and included commodities such as
    glazed paint pottery, obsidian, turquoise pendants, shell beads from the Pueblo
    villages of New Mexico, as well as bois d'arc and engraved pottery from Caddo
    settlements of northeastern Texas.</span></p>

    Mexico and the arrival of French hunters and traders in the Mississippi Valley,
    the lives of the Wichita were profoundly affected. By acquiring horses from the
    Spanish colonies, the Wichita could follow herds of buffalo over a much wider
    range and hunt them more efficiently. From the French towns in Louisiana, metal
    hoes, guns and buckets reached the Wichita. In some cases, these goods were
    used by the Wichita in their own daily tasks. However, others were used to
    maintain or establish trading ties with such recently arrived Southern Plains
    people as the Comanche.</span></p>

    harvests for the land by farming and hunting. During the spring, summer and
    early fall, they lived in grass house villages while the women cultivated
    nearby gardens. Crops were planted together in the gardens. Each summer, beans
    climbed the stalks of multicolored corn, and green-leafed squash or

    fall mornings dawned, women preserved their harvested corn by roasting and
    drying it in the sun. Pumpkins were cut into long strips and also sun-dried
    before being woven into mats, which could be folded and stored for later use.
    The dried corn and pumpkin were used in meat soups or boiled for side dishes.
    Cornmeal was made by grinding dried corn with a wooden mortar or grinding
    stone. This cornmeal was then made into bread. Pumpkin mats were often traded

    slaves in Marion County, meaning that African Americans made up twelve percent
    of the county’s population. Until passage of the short-lived Act 159 of 1859,
    mandating the expulsion of free blacks from the state, there existed for three
    decades little discord between the white and black populations of the county.
    By late 1860, however, the free black population had shrunk to eight.</span></p>

    first infantry company was formed under Captain J. R. Dowd. As more and more
    men were recruited and left home, the county saw an influx of men from other
    areas who sought to evade service and, banding together, began to plunder the
    largely defenseless homes and farms. These bushwhackers, along with groups of

    and its proximity to the nitrate deposits and Talbert’s Ferry, the primary

    opened in Yellville and Flippin. The first electricity generated in the county
    was at Blue Moon Mining, which in 1914 supplied power not only to its own
    facilities but also to the Elkhorn Hotel in Kingdon Springs. Ike Emery’s
    businesses in Yellville installed an electric generator in 1916 and supplied

    Depression increased the exodus from the county. Several banks in Yellville and
    Flippin closed, and some stores went out of business. The Civilian Conservation
    Corps (CCC) was active at Buffalo State Park (land now occupied by the Buffalo
    National River) and in a small soil conservation project in the community of
    Eros. Most of those who joined the CCC found themselves employed elsewhere in
    the region, such as in Russellville (Pope County) or Mountain Home (Baxter
    County). Other money-making efforts included digging for mussel shells and even
    occasional pearls in the White River, as well as raising herbs. Cotton had been
    a principal crop of Marion County since steamboats first came up the river in
    the nineteenth century, but tomatoes and fruits replaced cotton as the primary

    after the war, as many soldiers failed to return home. Some were battlefield
    casualties, but most were men who found better job opportunities outside the
    county. Hope to reverse this trend centered on a new pair of industries:
    tourism and recreation. Bull Shoals Dam was begun in 1947 and completed in
    1951. At the time, it was the fifth-largest concrete dam in the United States.
    This dam not only controls flooding in the White River valley but also
    maintains Bull Shoals Lake, which offers opportunities for recreation,
    including boating, fishing, and other water sports. (The lake also splits the
    county in two, so that residents in the northeast corner have to drive through
    Baxter County to reach the county seat.) The tourist attraction of Mountain
    Village 1890 was created at this time in the city of Bull Shoals. A re-creation
    of a late-nineteenth-century Ozark town, the village is a popular tourist
    attraction, as well as a frequent destination for school field trips. Another
    popular area attraction is the Bull Shoals Caverns, a set of caves in the
    limestone underlying the Ozark Mountains of the county.</span></p>

    hand, Marion County received some unfortunate notoriety in the 1980s when
    federal authorities raided the Zarephath-Horeb compound of a white supremacist
    group calling itself “The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord.”
    Describing themselves largely as a religious and survivalist organization, they
    were found to possess guns, other weapons, and poison. Their membership was
