    before the arrival of the Europeans.&nbsp; Since much has been lost over time,
    it is perhaps best to begin in the forested waterways of the Hudson River
    Valley.&nbsp; Ranging from “. . . the states of New Jersey and Delaware, that
    part of southeastern Pennsylvania lying between the Susquehanna and Delaware
    rivers, and the southeastern part of New York state west of the Hudson”
    (Weslager 1972: 33), the Delaware people today can be found in small enclaves
    across the U.S. and Canada. The largest populations reside mainly in Oklahoma
    and Ontario, Canada, with families and individual tribal members scattered
    across North America. Perhaps as frontier artist George Catlin noted in First
    Artists of the West, George Catlin Paintings and Watercolors (Troccoli 1993:
    52), in describing the Delaware character and reaction to the continuous push
    into unknown lands; “No other tribe on the continent has been so much moved and
    jostled about by civilized invasions; and none have retreated so far, or fought
    their way so desperately, as they have honourably and bravely contended for
    every foot of the ground they have passed over.” The Absentee Delaware,
    “absentee” being a description we were given early on, broke away from the main
    body of the tribe shortly after the American Revolution. European promises of
    the inclusion of a 14th state, an Indian state, were made&nbsp;as enticement to
    sign the first treaty in 1778 between the fledgling United States and the
    Indians. Of course, no Indian state was ever declared and by 1782 continued
    expansion of the frontier and the violence often erupting from that expansion,
    compelled the Absentee Delaware to move beyond the borders of the newly formed
    United States into Spanish territory west of the Mississippi River (Hale
    1987:1).</span></p>

    land grant from the Bron de Carondelet, Governor General of Louisiana, which
    they would share with the Shawnees. This tract of land was located northwest of
    present-day Cape Girardeau, Missouri, along a drainage known as Apple Creek.
    After 1815, the Cape Girardeau Delaware (Absentee Delaware) continued south and
    southwest into Arkansas and the Indian territories while the main body of the
    tribe continued to reside in Ohio prior to entering into treaties which would
    bring about their relocation to southwest Missouri along the White River. After
    the Cape Girardeau group began moving south, they would splinter into three
    groups; one group residing along the northeast Texas border, others near
    present day Nacagdoches, Texas, and the third group near present-day Byars,
    Oklahoma in McCurtain County. These Delaware, along with other bands seeking a
    place to live, would find themselves removed from Texas three times before
    eventually settling on Wichita allotments in the Anadarko, Oklahoma area (Hale
    1987: 2-5). Known until the late 20th century as the Absentee Delaware, then
    the Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma, we are now the federally recognized,

    mnemonic glyphs (somewhat similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs), these stories were
    traditionally shared through storytelling and at some point, an individual
    decided to record the stories onto wooden strips. The assumption by late 19th

    seventeen: “All of them said they would go together to the land there, all who
    were free . . . the Northerners were of one mind and the Easterners were of one
    mind; it would be good to live on the other side of the frozen water. Things
    turned out well for those who stayed at the shore of water frozen hard as
    rocks, and for those at the great hollow well” The mnemonic glyphs were
    interpreted in the late 19th century by Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, and from his
    interpretation the Walum Olum suggests two groups of people decided to leave
    their homelands in what is now modern day Siberia moving across the once frozen
    Bering Strait southward across the Yukon until arriving at the head waters of
    the Mackenzie and Columbia Rivers. There one group would move southeasterly
    over the subsequent generations eventually arriving at Namaesi Sipu, or the
    Mississippi River. As the first inhabitants of what is now the northeastern
    United States, the Waopanachke or Lenni Lenape, were known as the grandfathers
    addressing other tribes within the Algonkian family as their grandchildren. The
    kinship ties among the tribes comprising the Algonkian group considered the
    Delaware to be the oldest existing tribe among them which suggests we were the
    first to occupy the region. According the Walum Olum not all the Delaware
    people moved into the four rivers area, but one group remained along the
    eastern bank of the Mississippi while another group remained west of the river.
    From the Delaware who settled in the northeastern part of our continent would
    come our three clans; the Munsee (Wolf Clan), the Unami (Turtle Clan) and the

    Valley (Dorsey 1886; Hunter et al. 2013). During the Middle Woodland period,
    circa A.D. 200 to A.D. 600, the group travelled west toward the confluence of
    the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. During the Late Woodland Period, A.D. 600 to
    A.D. 900, the Quapaw continued down the Mississippi to the confluence with the
    Arkansas River while the Kaw, Osage, Ponca, and Omaha moved through the
    Mississippi River Valley to the St. Louis area as well as various river
    drainages in parts of present-day Missouri and Illinois. The Ponca and Omaha
    moved northwest to present-day eastern Nebraska during the beginning of the
    Mississippian period; the Kaw separated and traveled up the Missouri River
    during this time as well, circa A.D. 1200-1250 (Hunter et al. 2013). By the end
    of the Mississippian period, A.D. 1300, the group who would become the Osage
    left the St. Louis area and traveled westward to central and western Missouri
    to eventually settle along the Osage and Missouri Rivers (Hunter et al. 2013).

    Earth people to the south. Subsistence strategies included hunting, gathering,
    and gardening (Sabo et al. 1990, Sabo 1992). Villages had two leaders, and a
    council of advisors selected from the two clans. Daily life followed the rules
    and customs established by a group of elders. These elders underwent training
    that lasted from boyhood though seven stages of learning. The Osage traded with
    American settlers. Through these trade relationships, the Osage were able to
    acquire guns and horses that dramatically expanded their territory and control
    (Sabo 1992).</span></p>

    Quapaw social organization centered on a patrilineal system that united
    families into clans named after animals, heavenly bodies, or natural phenomena.
    The clans were linked through descent from a common ancestor, a factor that
    supported mutual obligation for the members (Wilson and Sabo 1990:1). The tribe

    a platform. Quapaw houses were constructed of arched poles covered in bark.
    Agriculture centered on squash, beans, corn, pumpkins, and tobacco. Deer, bear,

    to Michael P. Hoffman, “there is fairly good evidence that the Tunica speakers
    dominated east-central and northeastern Arkansas in the 1540s” (Hoffman
    1994:67). Linguistic and ethnohistorical research strongly suggests that the
    Tunica people were associated with several of the Mississippian Chiefdoms that
    de Soto encountered in the early 1540s. Linguistic data suggests that
    “Tunica-related peoples were present on the Lower Arkansas River in the
    seventeenth century” (Hoffman 1994:64), recent research suggests that the
    Tunica were pushed from their original homes on the Mississippi River by other
    tribes migrating into the area (Hoffman 1994:66-68).</span></p>

    the Tunica are known as sedentary agriculturists that depended primarily on
    corn and squash. Unlike most native cultures, the men were responsible for
    farming (gardening) while the women primarily gathered wild foodstuffs. As with
    contemporaneous cultures, the Tunica had a well-developed spiritual system
    related to the natural world. The Tunica believed in the supernatural power of
    the four cardinal directions and that natural elements were important
    supernatural forces. The Tunica also believe that the natural world formed a
    separation between the upper and lower supernatural worlds (Sabo 1992). This
    belief system is similar in many ways to those of southeastern Indians;
    however, a belief that the sun was a female deity and that fire was a deity in
    itself, and not merely a symbol of the sun, is unique to the Tunica (Sabo
    1992).</span></p>

    Tunica were organized into villages with circular houses arranged around an
    open plaza where a temple structure located. The Temple contained a sacred fire
    and was maintained by priests that would maintain favor with the supernatural
    world. Villages had hereditary leaders, but special leaders were appointed
    during times of warfare (Sabo 1992).</span></p>

    to French accounts, unlike most other Southeastern Indians, the Tunica were not
    involved in trade with early British colonists, but they did trade with the
    French (Sabo 1992). By 1706, the Tunica had abandoned their villages and moved
    to the mouth of the Red River. Trade intensified as the Tunica became military
    allies of the French. This relationship made the Tunica the targets of
    retribution by other local tribes. Continued pressure from white settlers,
    diseases, and hostile Indians groups forced the Tunica to migrate several times
    before they eventually settled among the Biloxi Indians along the Red River
    near present-day Marksville, Louisiana (Sabo 1992).</span></p>

    local economy. Over seventy-five percent of the county’s land is devoted to
    farming. Crops grown within the county include rice, cotton, wheat, soybeans,
    and sorghum. Light industry supplements the local economy. Light industry in
    the county includes petroleum production, freight transportation, metal works
    (parts production), furniture fixtures, lumber production, nursery and garden
    centers, sale of farm machinery and seed, and healthcare services in nursing
    homes, hospitals, and medical and dental clinics. Lumber production in the area
    is maintained with careful use of local resources and reforestation efforts to
    provide a supply of timber for the future.</span></p>
