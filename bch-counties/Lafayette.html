    (2002: 91) casts the Woodland period Fourche Maline culture, which arose
    between 1,000 and 500 BCE, as the predecessor to the circa 800 CE Caddo in the
    Trans-Mississippi South. One unsolved problem confounding this chronology is
    the inconsistency between Fourche Maline and Caddo burial traditions. The
    exceptional complexes of the Early Mississippi Caddo, typified by deep tombs
    and evidence of social stratification with pottery, textiles, celts, bows, and
    prestige goods, do not appear to be a continuation of a tradition from the
    preceding and relatively inconspicuous Fourche Maline. Schambach came to the
    conclusion that the evidence does not support a contention that one evolved
    into the other. Sometime toward the end of the first millennium CE., the Fourche
    Maline practices in the region ceased and the early Caddo practice, typified by
    Mound C at Crenshaw arose (Schambach 2002: 111-112).</span></p>

    the tenth to the eighteenth century, the Caddo enjoyed a cultural continuity
    bound by distinct mortuary practices, settlement patterns, and developmental
    sequences. However, the archeological record indicates a dynamic and complex
    cultural landscape that included interactions with cultures to the east and
    west. Nevertheless, the Caddo lived on the margin of the Eastern Woodlands, and
    warfare, population displacement, and late Post-Contact period cultural
    collapse are some of the defining Mississippian events that did not affect the
    Caddo (Girard et al. 2014: 132).</span></p>

    the de Soto expedition traversed the region in 1542, Caddo communities existed
    along the Red, Sabine, Ouachita, Neches, Trinity, and Brazos Rivers (Caddo
    Nation 2016). Seventeenth and eighteenth-century descriptions of the Caddo
    recount people living near the Red River Valley in the four-state area. There
    were three confederations of the Caddo: the Hasinai of east Texas, the
    Kadohadacho from the Great Bend area of the Red River, and the Natchitoches in
    northwest Louisiana. The confederations spoke different dialects and exhibited
    differences in ritual and material culture (Girard et al. 2014: 1).</span></p>

    the early Post-Contact period, the Caddo people’s primary European interaction
    was with French colonials. The French maintained diplomatic, commercial, and
    personal relations with the Caddo. In 1783, Spain took control of the Louisiana
    colony and maintained a relatively good relationship with the Caddo, using the
    French system as a model (Lee 2014). The Caddo maintained a substantial level
    of influence among the French and Spanish colonials, building alliances that
    strengthened them against invading Osage and facilitated trade. The Hasinai
    lived in the southern Spanish territory that would become Mexico. The
    Kadohadacho to the north became the focus of the United States as a regional
    ally (Meredith 2009).</span></p>

    thousands of American settlers had moved in the territory; they cleared land,
    built sugar and cotton plantations, and maintained a thriving slave trade. In
    time, the American settlers recognized the agricultural promise of the Caddo
    homeland in the Red River valley. This led to increasing pressure,
    marginalization of the Caddo, and ultimately, removal (Lee 2014).</span></p>

    of the Lenni Lenape, or Delaware people as we are now known, reaches far back
    before the arrival of the Europeans.&nbsp; Since much has been lost over time,
    it is perhaps best to begin in the forested waterways of the Hudson River
    Valley.&nbsp; Ranging from “. . . the states of New Jersey and Delaware, that
    part of southeastern Pennsylvania lying between the Susquehanna and Delaware
    rivers, and the southeastern part of New York state west of the Hudson”
    (Weslager 1972: 33), the Delaware people today can be found in small enclaves
    across the U.S. and Canada. The largest populations reside mainly in Oklahoma
    and Ontario, Canada, with families and individual tribal members scattered
    across North America. Perhaps as frontier artist George Catlin noted in First
    Artists of the West, George Catlin Paintings and Watercolors (Troccoli 1993:
    52), in describing the Delaware character and reaction to the continuous push
    into unknown lands; “No other tribe on the continent has been so much moved and
    jostled about by civilized invasions; and none have retreated so far, or fought
    their way so desperately, as they have honourably and bravely contended for
    every foot of the ground they have passed over.” The Absentee Delaware,
    “absentee” being a description we were given early on, broke away from the main
    body of the tribe shortly after the American Revolution. European promises of
    the inclusion of a 14th state, an Indian state, were made&nbsp;as enticement to
    sign the first treaty in 1778 between the fledgling United States and the
    Indians. Of course, no Indian state was ever declared and by 1782 continued
    expansion of the frontier and the violence often erupting from that expansion,
    compelled the Absentee Delaware to move beyond the borders of the newly formed
    United States into Spanish territory west of the Mississippi River (Hale
    1987:1).</span></p>

    land grant from the Bron de Carondelet, Governor General of Louisiana, which
    they would share with the Shawnees. This tract of land was located northwest of
    present-day Cape Girardeau, Missouri, along a drainage known as Apple Creek.
    After 1815, the Cape Girardeau Delaware (Absentee Delaware) continued south and
    southwest into Arkansas and the Indian territories while the main body of the
    tribe continued to reside in Ohio prior to entering into treaties which would
    bring about their relocation to southwest Missouri along the White River. After
    the Cape Girardeau group began moving south, they would splinter into three
    groups; one group residing along the northeast Texas border, others near present
    day Nacagdoches, Texas, and the third group near present-day Byars, Oklahoma in
    McCurtain County. These Delaware, along with other bands seeking a place to
    live, would find themselves removed from Texas three times before eventually
    settling on Wichita allotments in the Anadarko, Oklahoma area (Hale 1987: 2-5).

    seventeen: “All of them said they would go together to the land there, all who
    were free . . . the Northerners were of one mind and the Easterners were of one
    mind; it would be good to live on the other side of the frozen water. Things
    turned out well for those who stayed at the shore of water frozen hard as
    rocks, and for those at the great hollow well” The mnemonic glyphs were
    interpreted in the late 19th century by Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, and from his
    interpretation the Walum Olum suggests two groups of people decided to leave
    their homelands in what is now modern day Siberia moving across the once frozen
    Bering Strait southward across the Yukon until arriving at the head waters of
    the Mackenzie and Columbia Rivers. There one group would move southeasterly
    over the subsequent generations eventually arriving at Namaesi Sipu, or the
    Mississippi River. As the first inhabitants of what is now the northeastern
    United States, the Waopanachke or Lenni Lenape, were known as the grandfathers
    addressing other tribes within the Algonkian family as their grandchildren. The
    kinship ties among the tribes comprising the Algonkian group considered the
    Delaware to be the oldest existing tribe among them which suggests we were the
    first to occupy the region. According the Walum Olum not all the Delaware
    people moved into the four rivers area, but one group remained along the
    eastern bank of the Mississippi while another group remained west of the river.
    From the Delaware who settled in the northeastern part of our continent would

    cultures, originally lived together as one people in the lower Ohio River
    Valley (Dorsey 1886; Hunter et al. 2013). During the Middle Woodland period,
    circa A.D. 200 to A.D. 600, the group travelled west toward the confluence of
    the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. During the Late Woodland Period, A.D. 600 to
    A.D. 900, the Quapaw continued down the Mississippi to the confluence with the
    Arkansas River while the Kaw, Osage, Ponca, and Omaha moved through the
    Mississippi River Valley to the St. Louis area as well as various river
    drainages in parts of present-day Missouri and Illinois. The Ponca and Omaha
    moved northwest to present-day eastern Nebraska during the beginning of the
    Mississippian period; the Kaw separated and traveled up the Missouri River
    during this time as well, circa A.D. 1200-1250 (Hunter et al. 2013). By the end
    of the Mississippian period, A.D. 1300, the group who would become the Osage
    left the St. Louis area and traveled westward to central and western Missouri
    to eventually settle along the Osage and Missouri Rivers (Hunter et al. 2013).
    There are many historical references to Osage settlements along the Neosho and
    Verdigris Rivers in Oklahoma and Kansas (Berry et al. 1944).</span></p>

    (1992) described Osage tribal culture as being divided into two clans: Sky
    people and Earth people. Osage settlement patterns established villages on an
    east-west road with members of the Sky people to the north, and members of the
    Earth people to the south. Subsistence strategies included hunting, gathering,
    and gardening (Sabo et al. 1990, Sabo 1992). Villages had two leaders, and a
    council of advisors selected from the two clans. Daily life followed the rules
    and customs established by a group of elders. These elders underwent training
    that lasted from boyhood though seven stages of learning. The Osage traded with
    American settlers. Through these trade relationships, the Osage were able to
    acquire guns and horses that dramatically expanded their territory and control
    (Sabo 1992).</span></p>

    the Osage River, referring to them as the Little and Great Osage respectively
    (Dennison 2014: 5; Rollings 1992: 55). Many of the treaties make this

    Quapaw social organization centered on a patrilineal system that united

    The clans were linked through descent from a common ancestor, a factor that
    supported mutual obligation for the members (Wilson and Sabo 1990:1). The tribe

    a platform. Quapaw houses were constructed of arched poles covered in bark.

    what would become Lafayette County. Numerous tribes, including the Caddo,
    traveled from above the Great Bend and from what is now Louisiana to trade at
    the factory. Arkansas’s territorial papers record dramatic encounters between
    Indians and white settlers of the area. Though the United States government

    Militia raided Cherokee settlers in the Red River valley west of Lewisville,

    the defense of the “southern country.” Thomas Dooley also served at New
    Orleans, and his name appears several times in Jackson’s documents at the

    community. Several members of the families died during the first few years, and

    resulted in misery for almost everyone. Property and savings were lost, and
    genuine hunger and suffering abounded. Families who may have reported assets of
    $5,000 in the census of 1860, reported less than $500 in 1870. Farms went
    uncultivated, and what harvest was produced had little or no market. After a
    Confederate cavalry unit bivouacked on Long Prairie in 1862 for a while, it had
    to send its horses back home to southeast Texas for lack of anything to feed
    them. Ordinary citizens were traumatized. Newly freed slaves hardly knew where
    to turn, and former slave holders were outraged, not just for losing their
    slaves and fortunes, but for the general indignities associated with being
    defeated by their hated enemy.</span></p>

    this period may have been the proliferation of family farms. The post-slavery
    era resulted in the dissolution of several huge plantations into smaller
    acreage tracts owned and farmed by families. A few former slaves were included
    among the new landowners, though their share of the land was relatively small,
    never attaining a proportionate share of the total. Land title abstracts of the
    era demonstrate the efforts of the large planters to retain their holdings with
    diminishing success. Families eagerly purchased, often with mortgages, small
    portions of the former plantations and sustained themselves with diversified
    production. Though cotton was the main cash crop, they also produced edible
    grains, hay for livestock, cane for sweetening, and vegetable gardens. Diets
    were supplemented with wild game, fish, cattle, hogs, poultry, and other
    animals, along with wild berries, nuts, and fruits.</span></p>

    12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another dramatic change of the era
    was the arrival of the railroad. East-west tracks passed just south of Old
    Lewisville, and a north-south line connected it to Shreveport, Louisiana, in
    1888. “New” Lewisville appeared at that junction, Bradley outgrew Walnut Hill,
    and Stamps, Canfield, Buckner, and other communities appeared along the rails.
    At the turn of the century, the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad, initially
    intended to serve the interests of Bodcaw Lumber Company at Stamps, connected
    Hope (Hempstead County) and Shreveport, Louisiana. It would eventually be
    absorbed by the Kansas City Southern system. More important than the rise and
    decline of villages, however, were the rails for transportation of crops and
    timber. During much of the nineteenth century, residents tried to rely on the
    Red River for heavy hauling, but they were hampered by the extensive and
    persistent logjam called the “Great Raft.” From time to time during the second
    half of the century, the “Raft” was periodically declared cleared, especially
    after the work of the snagboat engineer Captain Henry Shreve. But it continued
    to be a nemesis until the river was mostly replaced as a means of
    transportation by the railroad.</span></p>

    harvest. It also dramatically reduced travel time to Shreveport, Texarkana

    and impressive sawmills rose by the tracks at Stamps, Frostville, Canfield,

    relatively smoothly, it was passionately resisted and opposed within the
