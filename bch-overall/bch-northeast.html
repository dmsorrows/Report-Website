    general sequence of prehistoric cultural development in northeastern Arkansas
    is similar to that defined for the region as a whole and to the stages of
    cultural development in the southeastern United States. The major cultural
    stages are Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland, Mississippi, Protohistoric, and
    Historic. In terms of European contact, the Nodena and Parkin people were the
    last recorded occupants of the northeastern Arkansas area. Following Hernando
    de Soto’s expedition during the summer of 1541, Native American populations
    seemed to nearly vanish. Furthermore, the expedition of Louis Jolliet and
    Jacques Marquette in 1673 along the Mississippi River saw almost no one in
    northeastern Arkansas, an area that which was once populated by the thousands.
    However, the first large villages Jolliet and Marquette discovered near the
    mouth of the Arkansas River were occupied by the “Akansea”, thought to be the
    ancestors of the modern Quapaw (Schambach and Newell 1990; 41). The culture
    history of this region has been previously summarized (House 1982; Klinger
    1979; Rolingson 1972; Rolingson and Schambach 1981; Hemmings 1982; Goodyear
    1982; McNutt 1996; O’Brien and Dunnell 1998; Smith 2007;  Whayne et al. 2013)

    history, or overview.</span></p>

    is known about the lifeways of the earliest inhabitants of the region during
    the Pre-projectile and Paleo-Indian stages (30,000 B.C. to 9,000 B.C.).  Lithic
    or stone tools including large lanceolate-shaped fluted dart and spear points
    are distinctive markers of this period. Based on ethnographic studies of
    small-scale societies and paleo-environmental reconstruction, it is
    hypothesized that the small band level societies depended heavily on hunting,
    fishing, and gathering wild plants for subsistence.  Many of the large
    late-Pleistocene species exploited during this period, such as the mammoth, are
    extinct. Most of the Paleo-Indian sites found in northeast Arkansas occur on
    the upper Cache River and on the eastern flank of Crowley’s Ridge (Morse and
    Morse 1983).  The fluted Clovis-like points from northeast Arkansas are thought
    to be “typically shorter” than those found on the Great Plains.  These surface
    finds have been comparatively dated with sites outside the region to about
    9,000 to 10,000 B.C. </span></p>

    normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>During
    the time-period of 11,000 to 10,000 B.P. (9000-8000 B.C.), the eastern United
    States experienced a climatic amelioration from more frigid, boreal-like
    forests to warmer, thermophilous deciduous forests. This gradual, environmental
    progression to a more humid climate prompted changes in various subsistence
    patterns in the Southeast. The Dalton Culture, which is defined as the
    transitional phase between the Late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic projectile
    point traditions, is argued to have occurred between approximately 10,500 and
    9900 B.P. or 8500 to 7900 B.C. (Goodyear 1982). The justification for this
    chronological placement is supported by Goodyear’s review of excavations
    performed in open-area, as opposed to sites found in caves and bluff-shelters
    in northeastern Arkansas. Goodyear concludes that basic stratigraphic and
    typological separateness defines the chronology for Dalton assemblages quite
    well. In that, various Dalton assemblages were discovered in strata altogether
    separate from adjacent, later occurring strata that included notched-point complexes.
    The utilization of a bluff shelters’ restricted space in upland environments in
    the Southeast United States combined with their frequent, long periods of use
    complicate the accurate interpretation of stratigraphy. Therefore, the
    utilization of these shelters are not, in most cases, suitable contexts for
    demonstrations of contemporaneity (Walthall 1998). Although these shelters
    present many difficulties in diachronic interpretation, it is evident that
    Dalton people were among the first to occupy caves and bluff shelters (Goodyear
    1982).</span></p>

    highly mobile foraging subsistence patterns that were characteristic of the
    those who lived during the Paleo-Indian stage are also characteristic those who
    lived during the Dalton phase. For example, the raw material that was utilized
    for portable, chipped lithic technologies suggests selection patterns designed
    to be anticipatory and flexible. The chipped stone tools used by Dalton
    foragers were typically manufactured on cryptocrystalline silicates. These
    manufacturing and selecting methods mimic the practices used by earlier
    Paleo-Indian peoples of North America. (Goodyear 1982).</span></p>

    normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Much
    of what is known about the Dalton period in Arkansas comes from the numerous
    Dalton period sites in northern Arkansas. Moreover, there have been over 750
    Dalton period sites recorded in northeastern Arkansas alone (Coleman et al.
    2013). Sites such as the Brand site, the Sloan site, and the Hawkins Cache in
    northeastern Arkansas have yielded a substantial amount of data about the Dalton
    period. All of the archeological investigations conducted on the aforementioned
    sites demonstrated that only Dalton points were functionally associated with
    Dalton components. In that, the points were discovered within a purely Dalton
    phase stratum among contemporaneous Dalton assemblages. The Brand Site in
    Poinsett County yielded 305 Dalton points and fragments, as well as five Early
    Archaic points and fragments. However, the non-Dalton, Early Archaic points and
    fragments were interpreted as the result of infrequent return visits to the
    site (Goodyear 1982). The investigation at the Sloan site in Greene County
    yielded 448 Dalton period artifacts including 144 Dalton points. Among the
    number of artifacts discovered, roughly 20 to 35 groups of artifacts were found
    spatially distributed in caches. Dan F. Morse, whose preliminary report details
    the excavations at the Sloan site, interprets the caches to be graves. As
    reflected at the Brand Site, three early Archaic points were recovered during
    the investigation. Again, these non-Dalton, Early Archaic points were
    interpreted as the result of a return visit to the site dated between 5,000 and
    6,000 B.C. (Goodyear 1982).</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-align:justify;line-height:

    the end of the Paleo-Indian stage or the beginning of the Archaic period (9,000
    B.C. to about 500 B.C.), the environment became much like it is today. In
    addition to Dalton projectile points, Packard projectile points dating to this
    transition are characterized by their lanceolate forms.  These types are
    represented in this region and westward to the prairie-woodlands border in
    eastern Oklahoma (Wyckoff 1984:130-134).  During the Archaic period people
    exploited a wider range of plant and animal resources than their Paleo-Indian
    ancestors.  The subsistence base is reflected in the numerous types of
    projectile point styles and a wide range of tools found in the Archaic Period.
    In northeast Arkansas, the Hardin and Early Stemmed Period is associated with
    an influx of Plains-like styles, and dates about 7000-6000 B.C. (Morse and
    Morse 1983).  Hardin points are rare, and again, have a distribution similar to
    Dalton points.  Other stemmed points include Searcy, Johnson and Hidden Valley
    points (Morse and Morse 1983).  The distribution of Johnson points extends to
    the southern portion of the Lower White River (House 1982). Later point types
    include Rice points (Morse and Morse 1983).  Dalton culture artifacts are
    relatively common throughout the entire state and assemblages have been well
    defined at several sites outside the region.  </span></p>

    normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>During
    the Early and Middle Archaic periods, smaller mammals, especially squirrel and
    rabbit, seem to increase in dietary importance. This increase is likely a
    reflection of climatic and ecological changes that occurred throughout the
    Hypsithermal (6000 - 3000 B.C.).  There is also a marked increase in the
    quantity of artifacts associated with plant food processing. By the latter part
    of this period, the domestication of plants, notably squash and the bottle
    gourd, is evident in western Arkansas.  However, in contrast to the Dalton
    phase, evidence for Archaic sites in the northeastern region of Arkansas tend
    to be more scarce in the archeological record from about 8000-3000 B.C.  Morse
    and Morse offer three likely explanations for the low frequency of observed
    material cultural within this region. Efforts by archeologists to accurately
    identify lithic typologies between the period of 6000-4000 B.C. may hinder our
    understanding of the Archaic period in this region. The scarcity of identified
    points in this region during the periods of 8000-6000 B.C. and 4000-3000 B.C.
    may also hamper our ability to accurately fill in the archeological record.
    Another possibility is that prehistoric occupants may have simply abandoned
    portions of the lowlands in search of permanent settlements. Lastly, population
    density may have been low in any given area in the region during this time
    period. If populations were distributed throughout the region, this may explain
    the increased difficulty of discovering intact archeological deposits in Northeastern
    Arkansas (McNutt 1996: 124).</span></p>

    normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Nevertheless,
    the archeological record reflects a resurgence in Late Archaic components in
    Northeastern Arkansas. The Late Archaic began at the end of the Hypsithermal
    period when the modern climate and ecosystems developed. There was a dramatic
    increase in the number of sites in the region, and for this reason Morse and
    Morse called this period the “Archaic Expansion.” During the Late Archaic,
    there was increased human adaptation to riverine environments and the culture appears
    to have been more sedentary than previous periods. In northeast Arkansas, the
    Late Archaic is subdivided into three sub periods: Big Creek (3000-2000 B.C.),
    Burkett (2000-1000 B.C.) and Weems (1000-500 B.C.). The Calion phase is the
    only Late Archaic phase defined for the region and includes Poverty Point
    period components typically marked by the presence of baked clay balls called
    “Poverty Point objects”, steatite vessel fragments, magnetite plummets and
    waste material, novaculite chipping debris, and Gary var. Gary points (Morse
    and Morse 1983).</span></p>

    Woodland period (500 B.C. to A.D. 1000) is identified by the presence of
    pottery, and in some areas the beginning of horticulture and agriculture. The
    noticeable correlation of agriculture, pottery, and burial mounds suggests an
    increase in social and ceremonial activities during the Woodland period.
    Siltstone hoes, indicative of horticulture/agriculture, are associated with
    this period.  The most commonly occurring diagnostic artifacts for the period are
    the Big Creek, Burkett, and Weems points and are likely carryovers from the
    preceding Archaic period. Other artifacts include adzes, celts, grooved axes,
    plummets, and choppers (Morse and Morse 1983).  The development of ceramic
    vessels appeared during this period, indicating a greater reliance on food
    storage and preparation as well as more sedentary lifestyles. Early Woodland
    period settlement patterns and artifact assemblages throughout much of the
    southeast clearly reflect a continuation of life ways and traditions developed
    during the preceding Archaic period.  There is undisputed evidence of house
    building, mound building, and elaborate burial ceremonialism throughout much of
    the southeast.  The atlatl, which was extensively used as a means of hunting
    fauna during the Paleoindian and Archaic periods, is largely replaced by the
    bow and arrow in the Late Woodland period and into the Mississippi period.
    Pottery manufacture began and developed during the Woodland and is generally
    considered a prime diagnostic for the period (Schambach and Newell 1990; 34).</span></p>

    regional sequence during the Woodland period has been subdivided into three
    periods: the Marksville period, the Tchula period, and the Baytown period. The
    Turkey Ridge and Pascola phases are subdivisions of the Early Woodland/Tchula
    period in Northeastern Arkansas, spanning the period from 500 B.C. to the
    beginning of the new millennium. Selected horizon markers for the Turkey Ridge
    and Pascola phases include biconical pottery objects, tetrapods on pot bases,
    Cormorant Cord impressed ceramics, Tchefuncte Stamped ceramics, Weems points,
    and reel-shaped gorgets (McNutt 1996: 131). Much of what is known about this
    period is illuminated by the McCarty site in Pope County. Although the McCarty
    site lies slightly west of the northeastern Arkansas region, the data acquired
    during the archeological investigations were enough to conclude that
    northeastern Arkansas occupants were mirroring the settlement patterns in the
    surrounding region (McNutt 1996: 125).    </span></p>

    turn of the millennium to A.D. 400, during the Middle Woodland/Marksville
    period, northeastern Arkansas is characterized by two distinctive cultural
    phases. Selected horizon markers for the Helena, Cow Mound, and Keller phases
    include exaggerated reel-shaped gorgets, Twin Lakes-like punctuated ceramics,
    vessels possessing Hopewell rims &amp; related designs, fabric-impressed
    pottery, pottery botanicals, Hopewell designs, and Plain ceramics (McNutt 1996:
    130-131). Late Woodland/Baytown period (A.D. 400-700) sites in northeastern
    Arkansas are categorized into the Hoecake, Baytown, and Dunklin phases.
    Selected horizon markers for these phases include mostly cord-marked pottery to
    the north, Baytown Ceramics, Barnes Ceramics, Steuben points, crude stemmed points,
    small chipped adzes, and Yates Net Impressed ceramics (McNutt 1996: 130).
    Assemblages from Late Woodland period sites in northeastern Arkansas indicate a
    large population within the region. However, Middle Woodland period sites
    discovered thus far, do not show evidence of condensed population centers other
    than the Mound City group near West Memphis. Further investigations in
    northeastern Arkansas may resolve the issue of unaccounted Middle Woodland
    populations in the area (McNutt 1996: 126).</span></p>

    A.D. 900 there was an increased reliance on domesticated plants and a more
    complex social organization as evidenced by status differentiation, specialized
    labor, etc.  These changes mark the beginning of the Mississippian period. 
    Material culture includes arrow points and shell tempered pottery.  This
    tempering technique allowed for the manufacture of a wider variety of vessel
    forms and decorations.  Exotic materials and artistic artifacts, often
    decorated with religious and ritual symbols, were traded throughout the
    region.  After death, important or high status individuals were interred with
    their possessions in sacred burial sites.  Other characteristics often
    associated with Mississippian culture include villages with palisades, temple
    mounds, an increasing dependence on agriculture, and the development of complex
    social systems.  Innovation of the bow and arrow occurred during the early part
    of the period and largely replaces the atlatl and dart common to the preceding
    periods.  Pottery evolves from jar and bowl forms common in Early Period
    Mississippian sites to a variety of compound effigy and bottle forms
    characteristic of Late Period Mississippian and Protohistoric sites. 
    Individual chiefdoms developed during this period, each generally consisting of
    a fortified ceremonial center, several fortified villages, and numerous
    farmsteads (Whayne et al. 2013: 31-38).  </span></p>

    Early Mississippian period sites in the region are marked by a change in
    settlement pattern from relatively small village communities to dispersed
    farmstead systems aimed at the maximum exploitation of arable soils across the
    Central Mississippi Valley.  Subsistence was based on intensive maize and nut
    agriculture but foraging also played an important role.  The development of
    complex hierarchical chiefdoms resulted in increased social stratification. 
    Flat topped, pyramidal temple mound construction began at some sites and
    continued until about A.D. 1600.  In some regions, burial mounds were built and
    used during the earlier part of the period.  Salt processing sites also show up
    for the first time during this period.  Decorated ceramics are a hallmark of
    Mississippian Cultures of northeastern Arkansas and have been the basis for
    building and refining local and regional chronologies. The archeological
    investigations conducted at sites such as the Zebree site (3MS20), Mangrum site
    (3CG636), Rivervale site (3PO395), Priestly site (3PO490), and Moon site
    (3PO488) prompted a number of inquiries concerning Late-Woodland and
    Mississippian period sites, including exploration of Late-Woodland period
    nucleation, emergence of new technologies, and the development of small to
    large-scale villages. </span></p>

    excavations at Mississippian affiliated sites. The varying levels of similarity
    in the Mississippian period archeological record has led to the discussion of
    the ways in which archeological phenomena is classified in the Central
    Mississippi Valley. As more data is added to the archeological record,
    assemblages continue to be split based upon their physical characteristics.
    Nevertheless, established modes of classification have provided a baseline for
    which particular assemblages are organized. The regional sequence during the
    Late Woodland/Baytown and Early Mississippian transitional periods have been
    subdivided into four phases:  Hayti phase, the Plum Bayou phase, the Owls Bend

    four phases that distinguish the Late Woodland/Baytown and Early Mississippian
    transitional periods in northeastern Arkansas have been interpreted within the
    timeframe of A.D. 700-1000. Selected horizon markers for these phases include
    Varney’s Red Filmed ceramic vessels, bone harpoons, jars without handles,
    flat-based jars, Coles Creek-like ceramics, Burlington chert microliths, pans
    and funnels lacking effigies (McNutt 1996: 130). Characterized by excavations
    at the Kersey site in the Little River lowlands, the Hayti phase is defined by the
    predominance of red-slipped Varney ceramics and shell tempered sherds with
    cord-marked exteriors (McNutt 1996: 227). While there is evidence of the Plum
    Bayou culture stretching well into northeast Arkansas, this phase is more often
    recognized for diagnostics discovered at the Toltec site in Lonoke County,
    where flat-based shell-tempered potsherds have yielded dates to A.D. 900. These
    sherds are also the defining characteristic of the Owls Bend phase in Western
    Lowlands of northeast Arkansas. Excavations at the Watkins site (3GE346)
    revealed a plethora of artifacts including a single bone harpoon. Given that a
    number of bone harpoons were discovered at the Zebree site in Mississippi
    county, it was determined that Zebree and Watkins were contemporaneous. Zebree
    also contains a component of the Big Lake phase dating to A.D. 800/850-1050.
    Additionally, sites that possess a similar component are found to the south
    near the Lower St. Francis River (McNutt 1996: 126-127).</span></p>

    two phases that distinguish the Early to Middle Mississippian period in
    northeastern Arkansas have been interpreted within the timeframe of A.D.
    1000-1400. Selected horizon markers for the Cherry Valley and Lawhorn phases
    include Scallorn points, as well as Matthews Incised, Manly Punctated, Obion
    Incised, and Beakers ceramics. Among the number of ceramics that characterize
    this time period, some are known to contain loop/strap handles (McNutt 1996:
    130). Much of what is understood regarding the Cherry Valley phase has been
    ascertained from the Cherry Valley site in Cross County. Archeological
    investigations conducted at the site revealed burial mounds built over circular
    charnel houses, bundle burials, and shell tempered jars with single loop
    handles, bottles, beaker-shaped bowls, and beakers (McNutt 1996: 234). A Middle
    to Late Mississippian Lawhorn component was discovered during the excavations
    at the Zebree site. The eight hoe chips of Tennessee Dover Chert found in
    context with other Mississippian period artifacts suggest a Lawhorn occupation
    for a period (Smith 2007: 58). </span></p>

    Middle Mississippian (1200-1400 A.D.) fortified village of Moon in Poinsett
    County yielded a sizable amount of archeological data that allowed for the
    determination of its chronology. Three domestic structures were identified;
    however, due to decades of agricultural disturbance, the evidence for the
    structures was by no means uniform (O’Brien and Dunnell 1998: 238). In addition
    to the three domestic structures, the investigation revealed twenty-eight
    square wall trench structures, all of which were supported by posts. Copious
    amounts of daub and mud dauber nest fragments were discovered around the Moon
    structures. Many of the daub fragments displayed pole and hatch impressions.
    Large sections of what remained of a palisade surround the village were found,
    including the discovery of a second inner palisade across the southern half of
    the village; although, time constraints in the field disallowed for a thorough
    delineation.  Projectile points dating from the Archaic to the Mississippian
    period were discovered on the ground surface, suggesting the recycling of
    lithic tools. This reuse pattern was also characteristic at the Priestly site
    in Poinsett county (O’Brien and Dunnell 1998: 232-241). Excavated features at
    Moon yielded 24,855 Mississippian period ceramic sherds, most of which were
    Mississippian Plain containing a pulverized grog and shell temper. The
    decorated pottery types among the coarse-shell-tempered paste Mississippi Plain
    vessels included: one Barton Incised var. Barton vessel, three Carson
    Red-on-Buff, one Mound Place var. Mound Place Incised, one Nodena
    Red-and-White, fourteen O’Byam var. O’Byam Incised, one Old Town Red var. Old
    Town, and two Rhodes Incised. The decorated pottery types among the fine-shell-tempered

    Langdon site is a fortified Middle to Late Mississippian-period occupation in
    southern Dunklin County, Missouri. Resting on the Malden Plain escarpment near
    the Little River Lowland, this large mound grouping provides further insight
    into Mississippian period settlements in the region. Mississippian-period
    Madison and Nodena projectile points, including elliptical and Banks varieties
    and narrowly chipped adzes/chisels were among the lithic assemblages discovered
    during the 1980s investigations. Ceramic assemblages include mostly Mississippi
    Plain sherds characterized by a grog, shell, and sand tempering.
    Thermoluminescence dating aided in pin pointing the chronology of the Langdon
    site. Of the six ceramic sherds that were analyzed during the investigation,
    five sherds yielded secure data. The dates from these samples ranged from A.D.
    1233 ± 51 to A.D. 1690 ± 34, falling mostly within the 14th century; however,
    Dunnell makes a correction of the initial dates taken from the samples based on
    porosity correlations. The establishment of these corrections are justified by
    Dunnell and Feathers’ findings on routine thermoluminescence analysis and the
    equilibrium of radioactive decay chains. Being that disequilibrium is linked
    with the porosity of a sample, adjustments on the Langdon samples had to be
    made. This readjustment places the samples between A.D. 1100-1500 (O’Brien and
    Dunnell 1998: 216). Based on the typological evidence present at Langdon, the
    assemblages suggest an intermediary between the Cairo Lowland phase to the
    northeast and contemporary phases farther to the south. The fortified,
    condensed settlement pattern that characterizes the Langdon site provides
    insight into the changing settlement configurations within the Malden Plain
    escarpment. These changes are also seen at the Vancil site, lying further to
    the north. The juxtaposition of the settlement patterns within these sites as
    compared to the elaborate, yet diffuse Mississippian settlements preceding
    them, demonstrates the complex changes seen at the Langdon and Vancil sites (O’Brien
    and Dunnell 1998: 224). Placing these sites into a broader context, however,
    remains an issue. </span></p>

    regional sequence during the Late Mississippian and Protohistoric periods are
    subdivided into six phases: the Nodena phase, the Parkin phase, the Greenebrier
    phase, the Little Red River phase, the Kent Phase, and the Belle Meade phase.
    These six phases that distinguish the Late Mississippian and Protohistoric
    periods in northeastern Arkansas have been interpreted within the timeframe of
    A.D. 1400-1650. Selected horizon markers include Chevron glass beads, Brass
    Hawk’s bell, end scrapers, rectangular shell “buttons”, Nodena points, Barton
    Incised ceramics, Parkin Punctated ceramics, head pots, and Catlinite disc
    pipes. Among the number of ceramics that characterize this time period, some
    are known to have applique handles (McNutt 1996: 130). While these cultures are
    considered somewhat contemporaneous with each other, differentiation in ceramic
    assemblages mark the contrast between the phases. For example, the excavations
    performed at various Nodena phase sites have revealed an abundance of finely
    tempered Bell Plain ceramics, whereas Parkin phase sites contain a majority of
    Mississippi Plain and Parkin Punctuated ceramics. Kent Phase sites’ assemblages
    contain Bell Plain to Mississippian Plain ceramics with Old Town Red, Parkin
    Punctated, and Barton Incised ceramics. Based on the historic record of the
    Hernando de Soto expedition, it is believed that the Nodena and Parkin people
    were visited by the 16th century Spanish conquistador; however, there is much
    debate as to the accuracy of de Soto’s defined “provinces” as well as his route
    through Arkansas (McNutt 1996: 242).  In the 1500s, European contact with
    Native American cultural groups marked the end of the prehistoric period.  </span></p>
