    distinct form of projectile point known as the Dalton point.  During this
    period, the megafauna of the Pleistocene were extinct and people engaged in
    hunting and collecting wild plant foods by utilizing a strategy that adapted to
    the emerging post-glacial, early Holocene environment.  The climate continued
    to become more moderate as the glaciers receded.  Deciduous trees expanded in
    range, and prairies with grasses replaced the forested areas as temperatures
    warmed.  Dalton projectile points have been found on sites in this region,
    although they are rare.  As is the case with Paleo-Indian artifacts, they are
    generally surface or isolated finds.  Test excavations at Site 3PL340 in the

    regarding Early Archaic occupations in this area is extremely limited.  During
    this time, climatic conditions coincided with the Hypsithermal warming trend (Sabo
    et. al 1988:55; and Wyckoff 1984:134).  Grassland plant communities expanded,
    while the range of forest species was greatly reduced.  Animal species that
    were common are similar to modern Plains-adapted species such as bison,
    pronghorn antelope, prairie chicken, and ground squirrel (Sabo et. al
    1988:53).  Although environmental and geomorphic changes occurred in this
    region, the nature of these changes is poorly understood.  It is also unclear
    how humans acted in response to these environmental changes. The Hypsithermal
    warming trend continued and reached its peak during the Middle Archaic period. 
    Evidence of Middle Archaic occupations in this region is limited.  Stemmed and
    notched projectile points such as Johnson, Big Sandy, Frio, Ellis, Edgewood,
    and Rice lobed have been found in this region, but “there is not a material
    assemblage or pattern of site distribution that clearly defines any of these hypothetical
    cultural systems” (Schambach and Early 1982:SW48).  Middle Archaic artifacts
    have generally been found as surface occurrences or in deposits mixed with
    younger cultural materials (Sabo et. al 1988:55).  There may have been
    increased habitation near larger rivers where the lowland forests remained more
    stable and the effects of climatic change were buffered (Sabo et. al 1988).</span></p>

    the Late Archaic period, climatic conditions began to warm until they
    approximated modern levels. In this region the return to a forested, riverine
    environment may have been slower than in some other areas (Sabo et. al
    1988:64). Much information about this period is lacking. Schambach and Early
    (1982:SW60) suggest that this may be the result of a population decline during
    this period.  Six sites near the Fancy Hill barite mining district were tested
    in 1979, and Late Archaic occupations are represented at five of these sites. 
    These sites are located on a variety of landforms, and three site types were
    identified: 1) upland hunting stations; 2) upland hunting camps; and 3) stream
    valley hunting camps.  Based on these investigations, a settlement/subsistence
    model was proposed that included seasonal use of upland and lowland resources.</span></p>

    sites have been tested and consequently archeologists are only beginning to
    understand site distribution and use.  The Rocky Shoals Site (3MN1708)
    displayed thin deposits, thirteen Pre-Contact features, and diagnostic tools. 
    Research at this site indicated that the site was multi-component with lithics
    dating from the Archaic through the Mississippi periods.  At this site,
    fire-cracked rock (FCR) features were identified along with food processing
    tolls such as manos, grinding slabs, and a chopping tool.  Estimates for
    depositional rates were hypothesized based on the intermittent use of the
    landform and the datable artifacts and features.  After the occupation
    responsible for the FCR feature, the lack of sedimentation indicated landform
    stability.  This observation was hypothesized to correspond to a return to
    mesic climatic conditions similar to today and the last 3000 years.  Cooking
    features became smaller through time and may correspond to a decrease in food
    processing, perhaps indicating a shift in exploitation.  Short-term occupations
    were represented by alternating episodes of hearth construction, disuse, and

    beginnings of long distance trade and exchange of raw materials and exotic
    goods, and the domestication of native and tropical plants (Schambach and Early

    Maline cultural traits were established and well defined by deposits at sites
    in southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1982). Sites of this period have dark,
    organic middens that developed due to increased sedentism. The ceramic industry
    is characterized by thick-walled, u-shaped decorated bowls and jars with bone,
    clay, or grit tempering agents (Schambach and Early 1982:SW38).  Stone tools
    include contracting stem Gary points, single and double bitted chipped axes,
    ground and polished boat stones, pitted cobbles, and siltstone hoes.  Arrow
    point technologies are not associated with this period.  The Fourche Maline
    culture was an important transitional link between hunter-gatherer foragers of
    the Archaic period with the more agriculturally oriented Mississippi period
    (Schambach 1982).  </span></p>

    important distinctions of Fourche Maline sites are mortuary practices and
    village size, which includes “cremation burials, burial mounds, evidence of a
    concept of honored dead, burial of most of the dead in the village middens in
    flexed or extended positions in shallow graves with few or no offerings, and
    small villages generally covering 0.8 to 2.0 hectares” (Schambach 1982:133). 
    There does not appear to be a great difference between the Archaic adaptations
    and Fourche Maline middens in terms of subsistence patterns.  “There is no
    direct evidence of gardening in the form of charred domesticated plant or seed
    remains . . . deer, fish, small mammals, birds, turtles, and mollusks
    contributed meat to the diet, and nuts; particularly hickory, were also
    consumed” (Sabo et. al 1988:75).  By the end of the Woodland period (ca. A.D.
    1000), essentially modern climatic conditions prevailed although fluctuations continued
    to occur.  This region probably exhibited the same distribution of trees,
    plants, and animals during this period as was visible before areas were cleared

    the Mississippi period some cultural patterns that emerged during the Late
    Woodland period continued and were elaborated upon.  In many regions of
    southeastern North America, large civic-ceremonial mound centers were
    surrounded by dispersed hamlets and farmsteads.  Elite consumption of sumptuary
    goods, hierarchical settlement patterning, and burial patterns indicate a
    ranked social structure; perhaps with inherited authority or political power. 
    The subsistence was based primarily on maize agriculture, although there was still
    a dependence on the hunting of game and the collection of wild plants for
    food.  Native cultigens, such as goosefoot, sumpweed, and sunflower were part
    of the regular diet.  Recovery of organic remains from archeological sites
    reveals that nuts, deer, turkey, raccoon, fish, and waterfowl were exploited. 
    Pottery was generally tempered with crushed mussel shell, which permitted the
    production of thinner-walled vessels than the earlier periods’ grog or
    sand-tempered pottery.  Sabo et. al state, “new vessel forms appear in the
    shape of bottles and carinated bowls, and red filming as a surface treatment is
    noted” (1988:105).  These vessel forms are extremely prevalent in mortuary
    assemblages.  Decorative techniques on ceramics became varied, and include incising,

    River valley, Caddo farmers were making salt up to 1700, when they migrated
    south out of the valley. The Kadohadacho Caddo and their neighbors along the
    Red River continued to live in their traditional villages near Texarkana

    control of the Quapaw and Osage when Europeans first arrived in the area.</span></p>
