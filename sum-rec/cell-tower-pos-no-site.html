    the request of EnviroWest, LLC., Flat Earth Archeology, LLC conducted a Phase I
    cultural resources survey for the proposed 21-ft CRAN_ROAR_DTLRS_389 monopole
    telecommunications tower site in Pulaski County, Arkansas. The UTM coordinate

    the archeologist excavated one shovel test locale as proximal as possible to
    the Project Area. The archeological fieldwork was conducted by archeologist
    Devin Sorrows, RPA. Field work was conducted on October 28, 2021. All the soils
    from the shovel test locale were screened through ¼-inch woven hardware cloth.
    A pedestrian survey of the entire project was conducted in addition to the
    shovel test to examine the ground surface for cultural materials. The
    above-ground survey and subsurface survey produced positive results. Personnel
    discovered an occurrence of modern cultural materials in the proposed Project
    Area. Each occurrence of modern cultural materials did not meet the criteria of
    an archeological site as defined by Davis, ed. (1982, amended 2010:B-8).
    Therefore, the occurrence was not recorded as an archeological site.</span></p>

    the request of Ramaker &amp; Associates, Inc., Flat Earth Archeology, LLC
    conducted a Phase I cultural resources survey of approximately .16 ha (.39 ac)
    for the proposed 295-ft Houston guyed telecommunications tower site in Houston,
    Perry County, Arkansas. The UTM coordinate for the center of the proposed tower
    is Zone 15S, 527393mE, 3877511mN. The proposed Project Area is situated in the
    northeast quarter of Section 33 in Township 5 North, Range 16 West. </span></p>

    proposed Project Area includes a 30.5 m x 30.5 m (100 ft x 100 ft) (.23 ac)
    AT&amp;T Mobility Lease Parcel, three guy wire anchor locations, and 9.1 m x
    67.4 m (30 ft x 221.1 ft) (.16 ac) Proposed Access and Utility Easement. The
    archeological fieldwork was directed by archeologist Chris Branam, RPA. He was
    assisted in the field by archeologist Devin Sorrows, BA. Field work was
    conducted on July 31, 2019. Flat Earth Archeology excavated 17 shovel tests in
    the proposed Project Area. All the soils from the shovel tests were screened
    through ¼-inch woven hardware cloth. A pedestrian survey of the entire project
    was conducted in addition to the shovel tests to examine the ground surface for
    cultural materials. The above-ground survey and subsurface survey produced
    positive results. Personnel discovered three occurrences of modern cultural
    materials in the proposed Project Area. Each occurrence of modern cultural
    materials did not meet the criteria of an archeological site as defined by
    Davis, ed. (1982, amended 2010:B-8). Therefore, the occurrences were not
    recorded as archeological sites.</span></p>

    is a realistic limitation involved with standard survey field methodology.
    Shovel testing is most effective in finding certain types of sites, those with
    relatively high artifact densities, or those with abnormal soil development
    such as middens. Thin artifact scatters are often difficult to identify in
    areas where surface visibility is poor. Furthermore, deeply buried sites are
    difficult to identify using standard survey methodology. Flat Earth Archeology
    made a good faith effort to locate cultural resources in the Project Area, but
    this is not a guarantee that no other cultural resources are present.</span></p>
