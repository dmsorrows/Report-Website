    the request of McGeorge Contracting Co., Inc., Flat Earth Archeology, LLC
    conducted a Phase I cultural resources survey of approximately 22.1 ha (54.8
    ac) for two proposed borrow pits in Faulkner County, Arkansas. McGeorge
    Contracting Co., Inc. provided Flat Earth Archeology with two KMZs detailing
    the perimeters of the proposed Project Area prior to the commencement of
    fieldwork. Personnel utilized these devices to maintain real-time location data
    on handheld electronic mapping devices, allowing the archeologists to
    accurately progress along each prescribed transect within the proposed Project
    Area. Flat Earth Archeology defined the west polygon as Area A and the east
    polygon as Area B. Flat Earth Archeology established 32 transects within Area A
    and 20 transects within Area B of the proposed Project Area. Shovel tests were
    investigated at a maximum of 20-m intervals along each transect during the pedestrian
    survey. Flat Earth Archeology personnel excavated a total of 448 shovel tests
    within the proposed Project Area, not including 178 shovel test locale that
    remained unexcavated. The circumstances that disallowed for the excavation of
    the unexcavated shovel tests included shovel test in roadway with impenetrable
    gravel deposition, shovel test on slope exceeding 20 percent grade, shovel test
    in lake, shovel test in fully excavated borrow pit area, and shovel test in
    inaccessible water compound area. All the soils from excavated shovel test s
    were screened through Â¼ inch hardware mesh.</span><u><span style='font-size:

    event of an inadvertent discovery of human remains and/or burial furniture
    during subsequent development or modification of the Project Area, the
    proponent should follow the protocols outlined in Act 753 of 1991, as amended
    (Arkansas Grave Protection Act) and other applicable state and federal laws and
    regulations. If previously unrecorded buried cultural resources are encountered
    during project construction, all ground disturbing activities in this area
    should be halted and the site should be protected until cleared by the
    appropriate authorities. </span></p>

    is a realistic limitation involved with standard survey field methodology.
    Shovel testing is most effective in finding certain types of sites, those with
    relatively high artifact densities, or those with abnormal soil development
    such as middens. Thin artifact scatters are often difficult to identify in
    areas where surface visibility is poor. Furthermore, deeply buried sites are
    difficult to identify using standard survey methodology. Flat Earth Archeology
    made a good faith effort to locate cultural resources in the Project Area, but
    this is not a guarantee that no other cultural resources are present.</span></p>
