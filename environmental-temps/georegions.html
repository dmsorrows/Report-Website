The formation contains chert, some minor beds of greenish shale, and occasional thin interbedded sandstone. The chert nodules associated with the Cotter frequently have concentric light and dark bands. The fossils known from the Cotter Dolomite are rare, but include gastropods, cephalopods, and reef-building algae. To date, there has been no success in differentiating the Cotter Formation from the Jefferson City Formation in Arkansas, although the contact is considered disconformable. The thickness is about 340 feet in the vicinity of Cotter, but the interval may range up to 500 feet thick in places [Arkansas Geological Survey 2020].</td>

The formation also has traces of conglomerate, shale, and chert in limited areas. The limestones are light-gray to brownish-gray and are generally more or less dolomitic and sandy. The dolostones are light- to dark-gray and generally more or less limy and sandy. The Everton Formation has thick members of friable, sandstone dominating local sections in the different regions. These sands tend to be made up of white, well-rounded, frosted, medium-sized grains and are almost indistinguishable from the overlying St. Peter Sandstone when observed out of context. It is not unusual for one lithology to grade into another along the bedding. Bedding throughout this unit is thin to massive. Named members include the Newton Sandstone, the Calico Rock Sandstone, and the Kings River Sandstone. Fossils are not common in the formation. However, ostracods, cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves, trilobites, and bryozoans are noted. The lower contact is unconformable and other disconformities occur within the formation.

The formation contains well preserved whole shells of brachiopods, ostracods, and trilobite pygidia and cephala. Fragmentary remains of crinoids, corals, bryozoa, bivalves, gastropods, and cephalopods are also found. Exposures are somewhat limited to small areas in Independence, Izard, and Stone counties. The formation is unconformable at it base and may rest on the Brassfield, Cason, or Fernvale Formations. The St. Claire Limestone is thicker in the eastern part of its outcrop area.

The Brentwood Limestone Member is a sequence of limestones separated by thick intervals of dark shale. The normal sequence usually has 2 to 4 limestone intervals; however, east of the type region the unit becomes more sandy. The Woolsey Member is composed of terrestrial sediments comprised of dark-gray, fissile shale, often interbedded with thin siltstones. A thin coal bed, called the Baldwin Coal, occurs at or near the top of the Woolsey Member. East of Washington County, the Woolsey is replaced by a thick, fine- to medium-grained, cross-bedded sandstone facies commonly referred to as the Middle Bloyd Sandstone. This unit frequently contains quartz granules and is a common bluff-former. The Middle Bloyd Sandstone is normally mapped as part of the Dye Shale. The marine deposited Dye Shale Member is predominantly a dark-gray shale with scattered calcareous concretions. Where underlain by the Woolsey Member, the Dye Shale frequently has a bed of calcareous sandstone with scattered clay pebbles and quartz granules, called the caprock, at its base. The Kessler Limestone Member is either a single unit of limestone or a sequence of limestone and shale interbedded. The limestones are bioclastic, oolitic, and contain abundant oncoliths, traces of clay-pebble conglomerate, and minor amounts of calcareous sandstone. The Kessler Member appears to be absent east of central Madison County. The Trace Creek Shale Member is composed of dark-gray shales with some thin beds of sandstone. The sandstone beds become thicker and more common toward the top of the unit. Fossils of most common invertebrate phyla are known mostly from the limestones and calcareous sandstones of the Bloyd Formation. The base of the formation is considered conformable, but unconformities are recognized at the base of the Dye Shale and at the base of the Trace Creek Member.

The lithologies include calcareous shale, arenaceous limestone, calcareous glauconitic sandstone, conglomerate, and light to very dark bluish-gray clay shale. The Midway Group interval is not normally divided into formations in Arkansas; however, various workers have indicated that it is possible to divide the unit into two formations: the lower Clayton Formation and the upper Porters Creek Formation. The Clayton Formation contains most of the calcareous and sandy lithologies, whereas the Porters Creek Formation is chiefly composed of shales and silty shales. The fossils of the Midway Group include a rich fauna of bivalves, gastropods, foraminifera, and ostracods with bryozoa, brachiopods, echinoids, crabs, fish, and crocodile teeth fossils also present. The lower boundary of the Midway Group is unconformable. The thickness ranges from a feather-edge to 130 feet on the outcrop; in the subsurface, the unit is usually much thicker [Arkansas Geological Survey 2020].</td>

In central Arkansas, bauxite is found at the base of the Wilcox near Cretaceous syenite knobs that were positive topographic features during Wilcox time. The sands are generally fine- to very fine-grained and light-gray when fresh. The clays are light-gray or brown and often sandy or silty. Frequently, either lithology will be dark brown to black when enough carbonaceous material is included. The lignites occur throughout the sequence, controlled by depositional environment rather than stratigraphic position. Some workers divide the Wilcox Group of Arkansas into three formations: the Berger, the Saline , and the Detonti Formations. Plant remains and trace fossils, associated with the lignites and lignitic clays, are the most common fossils present. The lower contact of the Wilcox is unconformable with the Midway Group and unconformities occur within the sequence. The thickness of the Wilcox Group ranges from a feather edge to as much as 1,025 feet with 850 feet often reported as average [Arkansas Geological Survey 2020].</td>

The Redfield Formation is typically a sequence of light-gray, thinly laminated silts, silty clays, and silty sands. Crossbedded sands and minor lignite beds are present in the Redfield Formation with plant remains being locally abundant. A minor disconformity occurs at the base of the Jackson Group sequence.

Calcareous concretions are regularly found in the unit. Fossils of pulmonate gastropods are fairly common with fresh water mollusks and proboscidean bones less common. The lower contact of the loess is unconformable with underlying units.

The dunes are best developed on the east sides of the White, Current, and Black Rivers. The dune sand fines with distance from these rivers. Dunes are present on all terrace levels, but not on present-day alluvium. No significant fossils have been discovered associated with these sands.

Scattered small peridotite-carbonatite dikes, breccia pipes, and sills are exposed in the Arkansas Valley, and a single outcrop of igneous rock with ultramafic affinities is known in the Boston Mountains. The total mapped area of the various exposures encompasses less than 15 square miles [Arkansas Geological Survey (AGS) 2020].<br>

                The largest of these bodies is a partially buried batholith composed of varieties of nepheline syenite that was exposed by erosion in both Pulaski and Saline Counties (Granite Mountain and Saline County intrusions). The Magnet Cove ring-dike and the Potash Sulphur Springs complex in Hot Spring and Garland Counties, respectively, are more mafic in composition, contain a greater variety of rock types, and had different structural styles of intrusion than the Pulaski/Saline County batholith. Several small explosive vents containing diamondiferous lamproite breccia and magmatic lamproite (formerly termed kimberlite breccia and peridotite, respectively) are present in Pike County. Numerous mafic and alkalic dikes are present in the eastern Ouachitas [AGS 2020].<br>
                
                All of the rocks mentioned above that have been dated by stratigraphic or isotopic methods are Cretaceous in age, ranging from 87 to 105 million years old. Small bodies of metagabbro and serpentine/soapstone exposed in Saline and Pulaski Counties represent altered ultramafic rock units which date from the late Precambrian Era (~one billion years). These bodies were emplaced into the Ouachita Mountains sedimentary sequence as solid masses during the Paleozoic Era [AGS 2020].</td>
